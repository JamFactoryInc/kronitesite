<h1>
    News system
</h1>
<p>
    I'm using this as a test for the news system. <br> These articles are added to the site's github repo and then raw.github is used as a sort of CDN so they may be populated after initial load. This allows me to have basically unlimited articles, or
    as many as github will allow, without a larger site payload
</p>
<h2>
    Backgrounds

<p>
    The backgriund of news articles can be defined to draw attention and make things pretty

    Articles are able to be clicked on if they are too long to view in the preview
